Significant changes since 7DRL release:

Updates 1 and 2:
* Messages etc. print nicely (respecting word boundaries)
* Radio transmitter is now cyan, for improved visibility
* Selected weapon is coloured yellow, rather than indicated with ______
* Added blue stars to make it clear what the maximum stamina is
* Targetting lines are now cyan when targetting an alien
* Added ? for ingame help
* Autotargetting now works when throwing
* Numpad keys now work for targetting
* Numlock may not be necessary
* Added Q to quit the game

Update 3:
* Included frivolous easter egg that slipped my mind after day 1
* Prevent moving off the map (after blowing up the wall)
* Prompt to press f/t again in fire/throw mode
* Randomly give the player advice (since people can't be bothered to press ?). M to mute the advice.
* Say what the montser memory columns mean
* Prevent player from being "trapped" (escape is easy with explosives) when the ship crashes into a building
* Automatically autotarget, don't just wait for tab
* Made the ? help neater and less verbose

Update 4:
* Draw bright colours for visible things
* Stop drawing things that are in LoS but out of visual range
* Don't generate aliens with identical representations
* Completely prevent plyer from being "trapped" (escape was still easy with explosives) when the ship crashes into a building (previous fix only prevented most suhc cases)
* Fix autotargetting so that it doesn't get confused when the previous target is alive and out of sight
*
