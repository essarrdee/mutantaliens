* Added blue stars to make it clear what the maximum stamina is
* Targetting lines are now cyan when targetting an alien
* Added ? for ingame help
* Autotargetting now works when throwing
* Numpad keys now work for targetting
* Numlock may not be necessary
* Added Q to quit the game
* Included frivolous easter egg that slipped my mind after day 1
* Prevent moving off the map (after blowing up the wall)
* Prompt to press f/t again in fire/throw mode
* Randomly give the player advice (since people can't be bothered to press ?). M to mute the advice.
* Say what the montser memory columns mean

* Automatically autotarget, don't just wait for tab
* Made the ? help neater and less verbose
