Significant changes since 7DRL release:

Updates 1 and 2:
* Messages etc. print nicely (respecting word boundaries)
* Radio transmitter is now cyan, for improved visibility
* Selected weapon is coloured yellow, rather than indicated with ______
* Added blue stars to make it clear what the maximum stamina is
* Targetting lines are now cyan when targetting an alien
* Added ? for ingame help
* Autotargetting now works when throwing
* Numpad keys now work for targetting
* Numlock may not be necessary
* Added Q to quit the game

Update 3:
* Included frivolous easter egg that slipped my mind after day 1
* Prevent moving off the map (after blowing up the wall)
* Prompt to press f/t again in fire/throw mode
* Randomly give the player advice (since people can't be bothered to press ?). M to mute the advice.
* Say what the montser memory columns mean
* Prevent player from being "trapped" (escape is easy with explosives) when the ship crashes into a building
* Automatically autotarget, don't just wait for tab
* Made the ? help neater and less verbose

Update 4 (ARRP 2012):
* Draw bright colours for visible things
* Stop drawing things that are in LoS but out of visual range
* Don't generate aliens with identical representations
* Completely prevent player from being "trapped" (escape was still easy with explosives) when the ship crashes into a building (previous fix only prevented most such cases)
* Fix autotargetting so that it doesn't get confused when the previous target is alive and out of sight
* Allow player to close the door (but not fly away) when the transmitter is destroyed and an alien is in the ship
* Notify player when hit by an explosion
* Don't allow explosions at the corners of the map to break the program
* Choose transmitter location more carefully
* Notify when an explosion happens
* Monsters no longer spawn in player's visual range :3
* Ask for device time and delay before targetting throws
* Put transparent windows in buildings, make doors opaque, randomly turn some doors into floors
* Overhaul terrain destruction - different terrain types take different damage amounts
* Cannon shots can destroy walls and windows (walls unreliably)
* Add critical hits (shoot a monster several times to figure out where it's vulnerable)
* Hologram, sound, scent, and brain devices all give LOS to the player, so they now function as spy cameras as well as distractions
* Overhaul message display to allow partial messages in the message log.
* Include monster health/stamina descriptions, sense descriptions (don't need to be discovered) and finer stat descriptions from Mutant Aristocrats!
* Alter sound levels to allow movement to actually be heard
* Make monsters screech 75% less often
* Make monsters' decision about whether to run slightly more sensible
* Draw running monsters with capitals, draw near-death monsters in red
