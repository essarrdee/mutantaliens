In this game, your SHIP gets a bit confused about some radio TRANSMISSIONS, lands you on an unexplored planet, opens the doors, and refuses to shut them.
Your only option, of course, is to pick up your RADIO, GUNS, EXPLOSIVES, and miscellaneous DEVICES, and go DESTROY the transmitter.
Hopefully your ship will let you CLOSE THE DOORS and get to your INTENDED destination once you've accomplished that.

Of course, this being an unexplored planet, it's full of ALIEN MONSTERS that want to claw out your SPLEEN and eat it. Hence all the firearms.

0 is the lowest difficulty, and is a bit too easy. 9 is the hardest difficulty, and it might be winnable! 4 or 5 is supposed to be the standard difficulty.

Memory:
When you see a monster, your observations are recorded in the monster memory.
You can immediately tell its size:
    huge (yellow), medium (cyan), small (magenta)
You can tell if its walk speed is faster or slower than yours:
    slow (between 1/10 and 9/10), avrg (10/10), fast (11/10 +)
If it runs, the same applies to its max running speed:
    slow (less than 19/10), avrg (19/10), fast (20/10 +)
A slow run might be faster than your walk!
If it attacks you, you can tell how strong it is:
    weak, strong, or dangerous
If you kill one, you can tell how healthy it is:
    frail (v. easy to kill), tough (easy, hard, or v. hard to kill)
